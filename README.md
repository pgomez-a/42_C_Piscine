If you don't know what 42 is, I recommend you first read my Github bio to understand what I'm going to show you. Nevertheless,
If you know what it is, I would like to show you the projects that I had to do during my Piscine period.
The Piscine is a programming intensive month where students learn about the C programming language and how to navigate within the Linux terminal. 

## My experience
I had never programmed in C before moving to 42. I had no idea how pointers worked and how variables could be declared. I remember after my first day at Piscine I thought
that it was going to be impossible to enter the academy. A month later, I was convinced that I had given the best version of myself and that I had learned a lot during the selection process.
Four days later, the message saying it was inside reached my email box. What can I say? It was the beginning of an incredible experience. 

## The projects
All the projects that I had to do during the Piscine are uploaded here. They could be useful if you want to start reading some code. You can use it to try to think
what the program is going to do and then run it in your shell or terminal. But if you really want to progress like 42 candidates do, I recommend you jump into the Piscine.
